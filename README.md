And so, this is an action that basically controls what is happening with all the files in here as well. So when you use another repository to run this repository, it's going to find this action, understand that it needs to use the Docker image, run the Docker file to generate the server, then this runs the entry point. The entry point is going to set up, "Git run, feed dot py," and then push that all back onto the server. And after all that, it should generate your feeds from another repository.
